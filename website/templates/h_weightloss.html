						</div>
						<p>Eat a light dinner if you ate a big lunch that day. Or, if you know ahead of time that you're going to a restaurant, plan to have lighter meals during the day.
							Make a commitment to eat slowly. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to get the message from your stomach that you are no longer hungry. Fast eaters often are over eaters, while slow eaters tend to eat less and are still satisfied.
							Make physical activity part of dining out. All you need is a comfortable pair of shoes. Pick a restaurant that's a 10- or 15-minute walk. You'll get your meal, 30 minutes of physical activity and avoid the parking hassles. Or, get moving as a group before or after eating. A brisk walk before a meal gives you time to chat. A stroll afterward helps your digestion. </p>

						<p>Having a body mass index (BMI) that is considered obese is often associated with having too much fat in your body. Carrying too much body fat may have harmful effects on your health, so BMI is used as a screening tool.

					
							
							As is the case with adults, the obesity rate among children is too high. Studies have found that children with obesity are much more likely to have obesity as adults and are at a much greater risk for health problems now and later in life.
							
							Many people have found long-term success by working with a registered dietitian nutritionist. Research shows that at least two sessions per month with an RDN lead to successful weight loss and at least one session per month for weight loss maintenance. Because no two people are alike, approaches to weight loss must be tailored to each person. An RDN can do this for you — she or he will create a plan based on your medical history, lifestyle and food preferences. 
							Together, you can explore how your habits, emotions and environmental cues affect how you eat.

						<h1><a href="#">Losing Weight While Breastfeeding</a></h1>
						<div class="metadata">
							<!-- <time datetime="2014-04-25T07:45">25 Apr 2014

						</div>
						<p>Breastfeeding requires extra nutrition, making healthy eating just as important post-pregnancy. Compared to women who are not, women who are exclusively breastfeeding use 400 to 500 calories daily to make the full amount of milk most babies need from birth to 6 months. Two-thirds of those calories should come from meals and snacks containing foods from all five food groups. The remaining calories come from the weight gained during pregnancy. While many women find breastfeeding helps them lose weight, weight loss varies among mothers depending on physical activity, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy and how much breast milk is produced.

							A slow, gradual weight loss of 1 pound per week or 4 pounds per month is a safe goal for breastfeeding moms who want to return to their pre-pregnancy weight. Women who eat less than 1,800 calories per day may reduce the amount of milk their bodies make. Stress, anxiety and fatigue also can decrease milk production. Do yourself and your baby a favor — relax and sit down to eat three meals per day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and choose healthy snacks between meals. Moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, also is good for you and will not reduce milk volume.</p>

						</div>
						<p>When children are young, parents and other caregivers are responsible for providing an environment that helps them maintain a lifestyle that is beneficial to their health. You can help your child by doing the following:

							Be a positive role model for healthful eating and activity habits.
							Provide a calm, reassuring atmosphere at regular meal and snack times.
							Set appropriate limits on screen entertainment like television, tablets and video games.
							Involve the whole family in fun physical activities.
							Help children develop and maintain a positive body image.
							Avoid restrictive diets and excessive exercise regimens.
							When it comes to nutrition and fitness, the role of parents is the same no matter the size of their children. A healthy weight for kids is about much more than numbers. It is about healthy behaviors, such as enjoying a variety of foods and activities for strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity.
