						<p>Breastfeeding requires extra nutrition, making healthy eating just as important post-pregnancy. Compared to women who are not, women who are exclusively breastfeeding use 400 to 500 calories daily to make the full amount of milk most babies need from birth to 6 months. Two-thirds of those calories should come from meals and snacks containing foods from all five food groups. The remaining calories come from the weight gained during pregnancy. While many women find breastfeeding helps them lose weight, weight loss varies among mothers depending on physical activity, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy and how much breast milk is produced.

							A slow, gradual weight loss of 1 pound per week or 4 pounds per month is a safe goal for breastfeeding moms who want to return to their pre-pregnancy weight. Women who eat less than 1,800 calories per day may reduce the amount of milk their bodies make. Stress, anxiety and fatigue also can decrease milk production. Do yourself and your baby a favor — relax and sit down to eat three meals per day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and choose healthy snacks between meals. Moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, also is good for you and will not reduce milk volume. </p>

						<p>Infertility affects about 9% of married women who are of childbearing age, according to a national survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While couples can't control all of the causes of infertility, they can control their eating habits. And, nutrition and a healthy body weight for both partners can have a significant impact on the ability to conceive.
							To prepare for pregnancy and enhance fertility, maintain a healthy weight and choose foods that will create a safe and supportive home for your baby's nine-month stay. This should include sources of folic acid, iron, and other important nutrients.

						<p>The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.

							Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy can be risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death.

						<p>The Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats. If you're pregnant, they may take on a greater level of "essential-ness." Alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA, and linoleic acid can only be gotten from your diet but they may help make two other types of fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. Many studies suggest these fats, particularly EPA and DHA, bring several benefits to both moms-to-be and the babies they carry.

							Fish is the richest food source of DHA and EPA, but most Americans eat very little seafood. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend women who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume at least 8 and up to 12 ounces per week of a variety of DHA-rich seafood low in mercury. This amount is associated with improved infant health outcomes. Too much mercury in the body during pregnancy can harm a developing baby's brain and nervous system.</p>
