						<h1><a href="#">Positive Effects Of Technology That Has Changed Our Lives</a></h1>

						<p>
							Technology can be a scary thing, especially for businesses that have found success doing things a certain way and are wary of changing their ways. Technology is also advancing at a rapid pace -- and sudden change is something that many people in general aren’t comfortable with. However, if you don’t keep up with new technology, you risk losing ground to your competition.

							To put your mind at ease, remind yourself that technology has always advanced with the purpose of making our lives better. Also remember that all technology was new at one point in time. Those who were open to new technology have been more likely to benefit from it. So keep an open mind when new technology comes out or as current technologies continue to evolve. We have compiled a few examples of how technology has changed our lives in a positive way over the course of history.

						<h1><a href="#">Technology Boosts Business</a></h1>
						<div class="metadata">
							<!-- <time datetime="2014-04-22T09:30">22 Apr 2014

						</div>
						<p>
							We live in a capitalist society, which means that a lot of the new advancements that are made in technology are made by businesses looking to improve their products/services or to improve their ability to market their products/services. New tech has also emerged over the years with the purpose of making business operations more efficient and effective as well. 
							Business strategies have evolved and improved greatly as a result of technology. One of the most basic elements of running a business -- the hiring process -- has been drastically improved by technology. It wasn’t that long ago that businesses were extremely limited when it came to hiring new employees. You would have to run ads in the paper or reach out to hiring agencies for help. Even then, the vast majority of your hires would be local. 
							Clear communication is vital in the business setting. Miscommunication has cost companies fortunes in the past because of an inability to communicate in time or in a clear manner between employees or between companies and their clients. In the not-so-distant past, the main method of communication was the phone. You would have to have a secretary to keep track of your schedule and you would have to hope for the best that you wouldn’t get caught playing phone tag with an important deadline looming.

						<h1><a href="#">Technology Advances Education</a></h1>
						<div class="metadata">
							<!-- <time datetime="2014-04-25T07:45">25 Apr 2014

							<span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit</span> -->
						</div>
						<p>
							Technology has benefited many more people and fields than just the business community. One underrated benefit of how technology has advanced over the past few decades is how it has impacted education. 
							Not everyone has the ability to attend college. Many people who would love to continue their education can’t do so because they are working, taking care of families, or live too far away from their local college to be able to commute. Online classes have changed all that. Now students can enroll into online programs or take single classes without having to leave their homes and at their own convenience.

						<h1><a href="#">Assisting People With Disabilities </a></h1>
						<div class="metadata">
							<!-- <time datetime="2014-05-03T09:00">03 May 2014 
							<span>09:00 AM</span></time>
							<span>Aliquam erat volutpat</span> -->
						</div>
						<p>
							Historically, people with disabilities have been at a huge disadvantage when it comes to their employment opportunities. Physical disabilities often restrict them from being able to physically  go to work. Because of how easy it has become to safely and securely communicate and share information through the web using a wide variety of software tools, more people are able to work remotely from home. This is a huge advantage to physically disabled people since there are now fewer barriers to their pursuit of a fruitful career. 

							Technology has also helped assist with certain specific disabilities. For example, individuals with speech impediments can use apps such as Speak for Yourself to speak for them. Individuals who may not have the function in their hands necessary to navigate phone menus or type on keyboards can use voice control programs.
